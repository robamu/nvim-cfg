nvim configuration
========

Personal neovim configuration.

```sh
cd ~/.config
git clone git@github.com:robamu/nvim-cfg.git nvim
```

You might need to run `:MasonUpdate` and `PackerInstall` again, even
though this should be a fully self-installing setup in theory.

Right now, this configuration has been used for work in:

- Rust
- Python

# Additional steps for Python

## `pynvim` installation

```sh
python3 -m pip install pynvim
```
